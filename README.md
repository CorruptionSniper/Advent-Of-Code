## Advent of Code 2023
**Attempted:** The first 2 weeks of the Advent of Code.

**Completed:** Day 1-14 Part 1 & 2, excluding Day 10, 12, and 14 part 2s:
  
  - *Day 10 Part 2 - Attempted* - Tried using a flood fill approach to eliminate outside tiles, however I realised that inner parts of the maze would not be eliminated
                      as they would not be necessarily adjacent to an outside tile. I know that I could develop the program to have the maze navigators store a whether
                      their left or right side is inside or outside the maze, however I have decided not to do this due to time constraints.
    
  - *Day 12 Part 2 - Not attempted* - A completely different approach from my part 1 approach would be needed to solve part 2 in a time-efficient manner, I was
                      unfamiliar with efficient techniques for solving permutation problems, and so was unable to attempt this task.
    
  - *Day 14 Part 2 - Finished* - Works on the base test case and simple custom-made test cases, however it does not work on my input for some unforeseen unique edge case.
